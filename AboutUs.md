Our team consists of 4 college students, Venket Arun, Abhiram Chennupatti, Tom Jeong and Arnav Arora. Tom and Arnav attend the Georgia Insitute
of technology, Venkat attends Georgia State University and Abhiram attends the University of California Berkeley. We came together for CalHacks 9.0 to
create the Crunch Time! Using the Cohere platform, we designed a software to identify the most important information in an image file inserted to summarize the given excerpt. We optimized the parameters of the API with fine tuning and training with a wide range of data.

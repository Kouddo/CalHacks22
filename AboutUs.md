Our team consists of 4 freshman college students, Venket Arun, Abhiram Chennupatti, Tom Jeong and Arnav Arora. Tom and Arnav attend the Georgia Insitute
of technology, Venkat attends Georgia State University and Abhiram attends the University of California Berkeley. All of us have worked with python and java but Venkat specializes in web development and design with interest in biomedical technology, Abhiram is highly trained in machine learning and AI, Tom specializes in game theory and simulations in molecular machine learning, and Arnav Arora works with astrophysics simulations and data science. We came together for CalHacks 9.0 to create Crunch Time! Using the Cohere platform, we designed a software to identify the most important information in an image file inserted to summarize the given excerpt. We optimized the parameters of the API with fine tuning and training with a wide range of data.
